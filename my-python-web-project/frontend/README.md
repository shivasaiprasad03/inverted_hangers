# Frontend Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains the frontend files for the My Python Web Project. The main file is `index.html`, which serves as the user interface for interacting with the backend services.

## index.html
- The `index.html` file is the primary HTML document for the web application.
- It includes forms for user input and sections for displaying results.
- The layout is designed to be user-friendly and responsive.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to access the application.
2. Follow the prompts to input data and interact with the application.
3. Ensure that the backend server is running to handle requests from the frontend.

## Development
- The frontend is built using standard HTML and CSS.
- Any changes to the layout or functionality can be made directly in the `index.html` file.

## Dependencies
- No external libraries are required for the frontend. All functionality is handled through standard web technologies.

## Contribution
- Contributions to improve the frontend are welcome. Please follow the project's guidelines for submitting changes.
